First things first:
The "body" of the component needs certain conditions so it can be used as an action, also needs to
have context of the page that will be executed, and in this case since we are going to get data from server
we need an APEX class to help with the work.

For the component to know where is standing, needs what you can see as "force:hasRecordId" (in implements)
That condition (that is called interface) is used to save the actual record Id, so we can work on that record.

For the component to be used as a Quick Action, "force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader" is needed.

An Apex controller is needed if we are going to update data (using the database)

-->
<aura:component implements="force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader,force:hasRecordId"
                controller="RedirectConditionalUrlController">
    			<!--In the future, Replace "CustomController" with an Apex class that you will use -->

	 <!-- This attribute saves the actual record ID -->
    <aura:attribute name="recordId" type="String" />

    <!-- Consider this as a placeholder for the object that we will take data from
		 First we get it from the server, then we read from the controller. -->
    <aura:attribute name="account" type="Account" />

    <div class="slds-modal__header">
        <h2 class="slds-text-heading_medium slds-hyphenate">Select Address to Show on Map</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="slds-modal__content slds-p-around_medium" id="modal-content-id-1">
        <lightning:button class="slds-button_neutral" onclick="{!c.openBillingAddress}" label="Open Billing Address" />
        <br/><br/>
        <lightning:button class="slds-button_brand" onclick="{!c.openShippingAddress}" label="Open Shipping Address" />
        <!--
           With the "c" in "{!c.nameOfTheFunction}" is how the component communicates with the
           Javascript controller.
           "nameOfTheFunction" Will be replaced with the name of the function that will be executed in the
           Javascript controller.
        -->
    </div>
    <div class="slds-modal__footer">
    <!-- The style attribute is necessary so the lightning components can have the same look and feel as the standard salesforce modals -->
    <!-- The values in style="margin:" may vary according to the space used in the component design -->
    	<lightning:button class="slds-button_brand" onclick="{!c.cancel}" label="Cancel"/>

    <!-- The height of the modal is defined in salesforce, when you create the new action. -->
