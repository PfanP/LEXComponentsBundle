<!--

The "body" of the component needs certain conditions so it can be used as an action, also needs to
have context of the page that will be executed.

For the component to know where is standing, needs what you can see as "force:hasRecordId" (in implements)
That condition (that is called interface) is used to save the actual record Id, so we can work on that record.

For the component to be used as a Quick Action, "force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader" is needed.

In this case we are using Lightning Data Service (LDS), so an Apex class is not needed.
